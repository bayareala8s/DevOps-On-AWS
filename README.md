"DevOps-On-AWS" is a Git repository that typically contains code, scripts, and other resources related to implementing DevOps practices on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. 

The repository might include:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts, possibly written in AWS CloudFormation or Terraform, to provision and manage AWS resources.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, possibly implemented using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or other CI/CD tools, for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
- Configuration management scripts, possibly written for tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet, for automating the configuration of servers.
- Monitoring and logging configurations for AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring tools to track the performance of the applications and AWS resources.
- Documentation on how to use these resources and scripts to implement DevOps practices on AWS.

Please note that the actual contents can vary based on the specific goals and requirements of the project.

## Add SSH Keys to GitHub

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add SSH keys to your GitHub account:

1. **Generate SSH Key**: If you haven't already, you need to generate an SSH key pair. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command, replacing `<your_email@example.com>` with your GitHub-associated email:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Press Enter to accept the default file location or specify a different one if you prefer.

2. **Add SSH Key to SSH Agent**: Start the SSH agent in the background (if not already running) and add your SSH private key. Enter:
   ```
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
   If you saved your key with a different name, replace `id_rsa` with your key filename.

3. **Copy the SSH Key**: Use the following command to copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
   ```
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   If you're not on macOS, use the appropriate command to copy text from a file to the clipboard for your operating system.

4. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**: 
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner, then select "Settings".
   - In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys".
   - Click on the "New SSH Key" button.
   - Paste your SSH key into the "Key" field.
   - Give your key a descriptive title in the "Title" field to identify it (e.g., "My Laptop SSH Key").
   - Finally, click on the "Add SSH Key" button.

5. **Verify SSH Connection**: To make sure everything is set up correctly, you can test your SSH connection to GitHub by entering the following command:
   ```
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   If successful, you'll see a message confirming that you've authenticated.

Now your SSH key is added to your GitHub account, and you can use it to securely interact with GitHub repositories.

## AWS

- AWS CLI get account details

  To get details about your AWS account using the AWS CLI, you can use the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command. This command returns details about the IAM identity used to make the request, including the AWS account ID, IAM user ID, and ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

Here's how you can use it:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This command will return JSON output containing information about the IAM identity associated with your AWS CLI credentials, including the account ID.

Example output:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AROAEXAMPLEID",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/example-user"
}
```

In the output:
- `"UserId"` is the IAM user ID.
- `"Account"` is the AWS account ID.
- `"Arn"` is the ARN of the IAM user.

You can use this information to identify your AWS account.
